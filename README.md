#Notes and Things

##Proposed Project Structure

Every project *should* have a:

- Good, informative title
- README (with many of the things included in the top answer [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2304863/how-to-write-a-good-readme)
- A license (which one, though?)
- Folders for each major class of files, for example:
  - M-files for running the experiment
  - Documentation
  - M-files for running analyses
  - (Empty, or only sample) data
  - Resources that aren't too big, and aren't generated on-the-fly
    - Sounds, images
  - Tests (esp. if moving from machine to machine)
  - Miscellaneous functions, scripts, etc.
- A .gitignore to keep undesirables (large datasets, identified data) out

I wouldn't bother with the github client -- once you have it from the command line, it's pretty straightforward.
